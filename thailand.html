  I visited Thailand as a weekend trip while doing Georgetown's Hong Kong study abroad program. This photo was taken from a diving boat as
  I decided to spend one of the days we were there diving. The marine life was unlike anywhere I had ever seen since it was the only time I'd been
  to south east Asia or been diving in that region of the world. Hopefully someday I have the opportunity to return.
