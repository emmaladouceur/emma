  Cuba is one of the most unique countries I've ever visited due to its history of socialism and turbulent relationship with the United States.
  The people I met in Cuba were some of the kindest and most generest of all of my travels. One of my favorite parts of the trip was looking out over the
  Capital building and the dome which was underconstruction. This trip was by far one of the most influencial experiences of my life.
