  Morocco was my first experience traveling to the continent of Africa. One of my Georgetown friends studied abroad in Rabat
  and five other Georgetown students including myself took a weekend trip to visit her. This country had incredible people, food, and history.
  I am so grateful for the opportunity that traveling abroad gave me to expand my horizons and better understand the world.
