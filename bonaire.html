  I first learned to scuba dive when I was 11 and since then its become quite an important part of my life.
  Bonaire, which is located off of the coast of Venezuela is known as a haven for divers as most of the island's reefs are heavily protected
  as marine parks. This photo of an Angel Fish was taken on my first day diving on a small wreck right off of the beach.
  We just walked straight into the water and there was an abundance of marine life.
