  During my Georgetown study abroad to Dublin, I had the opportunity to travel across Europe.
  One of my favorite trips by far was to Croatia where I spent 11 days in 3 cities. This photo was taken at the
  Plitvice Lakes national park. The lakes had the most beautiful, blue, transparant water. Despite going on an absoutely
  disgusting rainy day, this was one of the most incredible places I've ever seen.
