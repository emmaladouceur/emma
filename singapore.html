  Another trip I did while on Georgetown's Hong Kong study abroad program was to Singapore. Having the opportunity to visit this country
  inspired me to set up my career in a way in which I could work abroad in the future. The history of the country is extremely interesting
  and I learned so much about the role of this country during WWII that I was never taught in school. Travel provdies so much opportunity for
  growth and Georgetown has given me so much opportunity to experience it.
