  Another place I visited while studying abroad was Malta. Located off of the coast of Italy, Malta is one of the
  most popular Scuba diving destinations in Europe. This was my first experience diving and entering real wrecks and the diving
  focused less on marine life and more on the history of the boats we saw while diving.
